      "The formation of lateritic Au deposits and anomalies in the regolith depends on the mobilization, transport and precipitation of Au in the weathering environment (Wilson, 1984). Sequential extractions have been used to study the association of Au and other trace elements with principle regolith fractions (Boyle, 1979; Lintern, 1989; Gray and Lintern, 1998; Xueqiu, 1998), and to infer element mobility. Other studies have shown that Au is mobile in the Australian regolith in and around mineralized zones (Mann, 1984; Gray and Lintern, 1998; Reith et al., 2005). For instance, at the Tomakin Park Gold Mine in south eastern New South Wales approximately 50wt% of the total Au in the Ah-horizon overlying the mineralized zone was associated with the water-, ammonium-acetate-, sodium pyrophosphate- and hydroxylamine-hydrochloride-soluble fractions; in contrast, in the unweathered quartz-vein material more than 95wt% of the Au was extractable only with concentrated aqua regia and appeared to be strongly bound in pyrite and arsenopyrite (Reith et al., 2005).There is growing evidence that microbiota contribute to the biogeochemical cycling of Au in the Australian regolith (Reith and McPhail, 2006; Reith et al., 2006). A microcosm study conducted by Reith and McPhail (2006) with auriferous soils from the Tomakin Park Gold Mine has shown that the indigenous microbiota of these soils are capable of solubilizing up to 80wt% of the finely disseminated Au adsorbed to the solid soil fractions as well as Au from the added Au pellets within 30–40 days of incubation, after which the solubilized Au was either adsorbed to the solid fractions or precipitated; in contrast, little to no Au was solubilized in biologically inactive (i.e., sterilized) microcosms. This behavior correlated with a change in the heterotrophic bacterial community structure in the microcosms from a dominantly carbohydrate- to an amino-acid utilizing population. They also found that the bacterial community in the early stages of the incubation produced amino acids, which may contribute to the solubilization of Au. Further evidence for this comes from in vitro studies with pure bacterial cultures, where it has been shown that microbially produced amino acids solubilize and form strong complexes with Au (Pares and Martinet, 1964; Lyalikova and Mockeicheva, 1969; Korobushkina et al., 1974; Korobushkina et al., 1983).Arsenic is an important pathfinder element for Au and commonly used in mineral exploration, because of its generally wider halo around primary mineralization, which makes it easier to detect in geochemical surveys (Cavender, 1963; Boyle and Jonasson, 1973; Boyle, 1979; Yang and Blum, 1999). In primary mineralization As and Au are commonly associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS; Boyle, 1979; King, 2002). Oxidation and subsequent breakdown of the mineral by iron- and sulfur oxidizing bacteria leads to the mobilization of As and Au (Nordstrom and Southam, 1997; Garcia-Sanchez and Alvarez-Ayuso, 2003; Papassiopi et al., 2003). The acidic and oxidizing conditions established by the bacteria not only create favorable conditions for indirect As and Au mobilization by dissolving the arsenopyrite, they also increase dissolved concentrations of these metals, and thus may contribute to their dispersion into the regolith (Bayard et al., 2006).In the regolith the speciation of As is controlled by the pH and redox conditions, (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002; Oremland and Stolz, 2003); where arsenate species (i.e., As(V) as \n",

The concentrations of dissolved arsenate and arsenite are controlled by surface complexation reactions on oxides and hydroxides of Al, Mn and especially Fe (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002; Oremland and Stolz, 2003). Arsenate is strongly adsorbed to Al-, Mn- and Fe-oxides under typical pH conditions, and as such unlikely to be mobile, whereas arsenite adsorbs less strongly and to fewer minerals and is the more mobile form (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002). Turnover of arsenate to arsenite and vice versa is used by a range of bacteria common in the regolith to gain metabolic energy, and thus resident microbiota may also contribute to the speciation and mobility of As in the regolith (Ahmann et al., 1997; Oremland and Stolz, 2003).While these findings suggest that Au and As may be highly mobile in and around mineralized zones in the Australian regolith, a recent study using sequential extractions with samples from the Tomakin Park Gold Mine suggests that the mobility of As, in contrast to Au mobility, is limited (Reith et al., 2005). There also is a need to understand the influence of microbial processes on the solubilization of Au and As under a wider range of environmental conditions. Therefore, the aims of this study are to: (i) infer the mobility of Au and As in regolith samples from a semi-arid and a tropical site by determining their fractionation using sequential extractions on progressively weathered materials; and (ii) assess the microbially mediated solubilization of Au and As in the different regolith materials using microcosms. Samples of auriferous soils and deeper regolith materials overlying the deposits were obtained from the Peak Hill Gold Mine in semi-arid New South Wales, and the Hit or Miss Mine in the Palmer River Goldfields in tropical north eastern Queensland.The results and discussion section consists of three subsections. In the first subsection the bulk geochemistry, the mineralogy of the regolith materials and the results of the sequential extraction for Au and As are presented. The second subsection focuses on the solubilization of Au and As in biologically active and inactive (sterilized) microcosms. In the third subsection the implications of these results for the mobility and mobilization of Au and As in the regolith are discussed.The results of this study show that Au is mobile in regolith materials from tropical and semi-arid areas in Australia, similar to the results of Reith and McPhail (2006) for a temperate area in Australia, whereas As mobility appear limited. Using biologically active versus inactive microcosms, we have demonstrated an effect of the indigenous microbiota of auriferous soils from semi-arid and tropical sites on the solubilization of Au, and for As in regolith from the tropical site. Thus, this study and Reith and McPhail (2006) have demonstrated that the activity of microorganisms needs to be taken into account when studying the mobility, solubilization and transport of Au and As in a wide range of regolith environments in Australia. The study has also shown that the capacity of microbiota to solubilize Au and As, and the timing and total concentrations of Au released into solution varies greatly between samples from different sites. This indicates that environmental factors such as climate, soil geochemistry, substrate quality and availability influence the microbially mediated solubilization of Au and As by influencing the composition and activity of the indigenous soil microbiota. More research is necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms of how and when microbiota interact with the Au and As. The species, or groups of bacteria and other microorganisms that are affecting Au and As mobility need to be identified more specifically using modern molecular microbial approaches such as fingerprinting and sequencing of community 16S rDNA (Reith et al., 2006). In addition, the speciation of Au, e.g., dissolved complexes, colloids, needs to be identified. By making such detailed measurements we will be able to learn more about the mechanisms as well as the kinetics of these processes. Ultimately, we may be able to incorporate appropriate data into numerical geochemical models to predict Au and As transport, which will be useful in developing successful gold exploration and ore-processing strategies.The formation of lateritic Au deposits and anomalies in the regolith depends on the mobilization, transport and precipitation of Au in the weathering environment (Wilson, 1984).

The concentrations of dissolved arsenate and arsenite are controlled by surface complexation reactions on oxides and hydroxides of Al, Mn and especially Fe (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002; Oremland and Stolz, 2003). Arsenate is strongly adsorbed to Al-, Mn- and Fe-oxides under typical pH conditions, and as such unlikely to be mobile, whereas arsenite adsorbs less strongly and to fewer minerals and is the more mobile form (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002). Turnover of arsenate to arsenite and vice versa is used by a range of bacteria common in the regolith to gain metabolic energy, and thus resident microbiota may also contribute to the speciation and mobility of As in the regolith (Ahmann et al., 1997; Oremland and Stolz, 2003).While these findings suggest that Au and As may be highly mobile in and around mineralized zones in the Australian regolith, a recent study using sequential extractions with samples from the Tomakin Park Gold Mine suggests that the mobility of As, in contrast to Au mobility, is limited (Reith et al., 2005). There also is a need to understand the influence of microbial processes on the solubilization of Au and As under a wider range of environmental conditions. Therefore, the aims of this study are to: (i) infer the mobility of Au and As in regolith samples from a semi-arid and a tropical site by determining their fractionation using sequential extractions on progressively weathered materials; and (ii) assess the microbially mediated solubilization of Au and As in the different regolith materials using microcosms. Samples of auriferous soils and deeper regolith materials overlying the deposits were obtained from the Peak Hill Gold Mine in semi-arid New South Wales, and the Hit or Miss Mine in the Palmer River Goldfields in tropical north eastern Queensland.The results and discussion section consists of three subsections. In the first subsection the bulk geochemistry, the mineralogy of the regolith materials and the results of the sequential extraction for Au and As are presented. The second subsection focuses on the solubilization of Au and As in biologically active and inactive (sterilized) microcosms. In the third subsection the implications of these results for the mobility and mobilization of Au and As in the regolith are discussed.The results of this study show that Au is mobile in regolith materials from tropical and semi-arid areas in Australia, similar to the results of Reith and McPhail (2006) for a temperate area in Australia, whereas As mobility appear limited. Using biologically active versus inactive microcosms, we have demonstrated an effect of the indigenous microbiota of auriferous soils from semi-arid and tropical sites on the solubilization of Au, and for As in regolith from the tropical site. Thus, this study and Reith and McPhail (2006) have demonstrated that the activity of microorganisms needs to be taken into account when studying the mobility, solubilization and transport of Au and As in a wide range of regolith environments in Australia. The study has also shown that the capacity of microbiota to solubilize Au and As, and the timing and total concentrations of Au released into solution varies greatly between samples from different sites. This indicates that environmental factors such as climate, soil geochemistry, substrate quality and availability influence the microbially mediated solubilization of Au and As by influencing the composition and activity of the indigenous soil microbiota. More research is necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms of how and when microbiota interact with the Au and As. The species, or groups of bacteria and other microorganisms that are affecting Au and As mobility need to be identified more specifically using modern molecular microbial approaches such as fingerprinting and sequencing of community 16S rDNA (Reith et al., 2006). In addition, the speciation of Au, e.g., dissolved complexes, colloids, needs to be identified. By making such detailed measurements we will be able to learn more about the mechanisms as well as the kinetics of these processes. Ultimately, we may be able to incorporate appropriate data into numerical geochemical models to predict Au and As transport, which will be useful in developing successful gold exploration and ore-processing strategies.The formation of lateritic Au deposits and anomalies in the regolith depends on the mobilization, transport and precipitation of Au in the weathering environment (Wilson, 1984). Sequential extractions have been used to study the association of Au and other trace elements with principle regolith fractions (Boyle, 1979; Lintern, 1989; Gray and Lintern, 1998; Xueqiu, 1998), and to infer element mobility. Other studies have shown that Au is mobile in the Australian regolith in and around mineralized zones (Mann, 1984; Gray and Lintern, 1998; Reith et al., 2005). For instance, at the Tomakin Park Gold Mine in south eastern New South Wales approximately 50wt% of the total Au in the Ah-horizon overlying the mineralized zone was associated with the water-, ammonium-acetate-, sodium pyrophosphate- and hydroxylamine-hydrochloride-soluble fractions; in contrast, in the unweathered quartz-vein material more than 95wt% of the Au was extractable only with concentrated aqua regia and appeared to be strongly bound in pyrite and arsenopyrite (Reith et al., 2005).There is growing evidence that microbiota contribute to the biogeochemical cycling of Au in the Australian regolith (Reith and McPhail, 2006; Reith et al., 2006). A microcosm study conducted by Reith and McPhail (2006) with auriferous soils from the Tomakin Park Gold Mine has shown that the indigenous microbiota of these soils are capable of solubilizing up to 80wt% of the finely disseminated Au adsorbed to the solid soil fractions as well as Au from the added Au pellets within 30–40 days of incubation, after which the solubilized Au was either adsorbed to the solid fractions or precipitated; in contrast, little to no Au was solubilized in biologically inactive (i.e., sterilized) microcosms. This behavior correlated with a change in the heterotrophic bacterial community structure in the microcosms from a dominantly carbohydrate- to an amino-acid utilizing population. They also found that the bacterial community in the early stages of the incubation produced amino acids, which may contribute to the solubilization of Au. Further evidence for this comes from in vitro studies with pure bacterial cultures, where it has been shown that microbially produced amino acids solubilize and form strong complexes with Au (Pares and Martinet, 1964; Lyalikova and Mockeicheva, 1969; Korobushkina et al., 1974; Korobushkina et al., 1983).Arsenic is an important pathfinder element for Au and commonly used in mineral exploration, because of its generally wider halo around primary mineralization, which makes it easier to detect in geochemical surveys (Cavender, 1963; Boyle and Jonasson, 1973; Boyle, 1979; Yang and Blum, 1999). In primary mineralization As and Au are commonly associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS; Boyle, 1979; King, 2002). Oxidation and subsequent breakdown of the mineral by iron- and sulfur oxidizing bacteria leads to the mobilization of As and Au (Nordstrom and Southam, 1997; Garcia-Sanchez and Alvarez-Ayuso, 2003; Papassiopi et al., 2003). The acidic and oxidizing conditions established by the bacteria not only create favorable conditions for indirect As and Au mobilization by dissolving the arsenopyrite, they also increase dissolved concentrations of these metals, and thus may contribute to their dispersion into the regolith (Bayard et al., 2006).In the regolith the speciation of As is controlled by the pH and redox conditions, (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002; Oremland and Stolz, 2003); where arsenate species (i.e., As(V) as \n",

Therefore, the aims of this study are to: (i) infer the mobility of Au and As in regolith samples from a semi-arid and a tropical site by determining their fractionation using sequential extractions on progressively weathered materials; and (ii) assess the microbially mediated solubilization of Au and As in the different regolith materials using microcosms. Samples of auriferous soils and deeper regolith materials overlying the deposits were obtained from the Peak Hill Gold Mine in semi-arid New South Wales, and the Hit or Miss Mine in the Palmer River Goldfields in tropical north eastern Queensland.The results and discussion section consists of three subsections. In the first subsection the bulk geochemistry, the mineralogy of the regolith materials and the results of the sequential extraction for Au and As are presented. The second subsection focuses on the solubilization of Au and As in biologically active and inactive (sterilized) microcosms. In the third subsection the implications of these results for the mobility and mobilization of Au and As in the regolith are discussed.The results of this study show that Au is mobile in regolith materials from tropical and semi-arid areas in Australia, similar to the results of Reith and McPhail (2006) for a temperate area in Australia, whereas As mobility appear limited. Using biologically active versus inactive microcosms, we have demonstrated an effect of the indigenous microbiota of auriferous soils from semi-arid and tropical sites on the solubilization of Au, and for As in regolith from the tropical site. Thus, this study and Reith and McPhail (2006) have demonstrated that the activity of microorganisms needs to be taken into account when studying the mobility, solubilization and transport of Au and As in a wide range of regolith environments in Australia. The study has also shown that the capacity of microbiota to solubilize Au and As, and the timing and total concentrations of Au released into solution varies greatly between samples from different sites. This indicates that environmental factors such as climate, soil geochemistry, substrate quality and availability influence the microbially mediated solubilization of Au and As by influencing the composition and activity of the indigenous soil microbiota. More research is necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms of how and when microbiota interact with the Au and As. The species, or groups of bacteria and other microorganisms that are affecting Au and As mobility need to be identified more specifically using modern molecular microbial approaches such as fingerprinting and sequencing of community 16S rDNA (Reith et al., 2006). In addition, the speciation of Au, e.g., dissolved complexes, colloids, needs to be identified. By making such detailed measurements we will be able to learn more about the mechanisms as well as the kinetics of these processes. Ultimately, we may be able to incorporate appropriate data into numerical geochemical models to predict Au and As transport, which will be useful in developing successful gold exploration and ore-processing strategies.Recent developments in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging technology provide various efficient data acquisition schemes of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) echo trains with multiple wait times and multiple echo spacings in unique magnetic field gradients [1–3].

Here we used a 2D cutoff method that divides a 2D map into several saturation regions according to prior knowledge of various fluids.Furthermore, different logging techniques give different types of measurements of petrophysical parameters. For example, resistivity logs usually give very accurate water saturation information based on Archie's law, while neutron/density crossplots can yield accurate porosity and clay-bound water volume. Combining NMR logging with resistivity and/or neutron/density logs provides us a third method for in situ fluid typing.

Under this circumstance, we often combine NMR-measured results with other logs for correct reservoir evaluation. For example, resistivity logs usually give a very accurate water volume ratio, while neutron/density crossplots can yield accurate formation porosity and clay-bound water volume. We have successfully combined NMR analysis with resistivity logs and neutron/density logs to derive the apparent hydrogen index, which can be used to establish correlations with oil viscosity and then to estimate oil viscosity in an extremely heavy oil field.The apparent hydrogen index is defined by:\n",

Under this circumstance, we often combine NMR-measured results with other logs for correct reservoir evaluation. For example, resistivity logs usually give a very accurate water volume ratio, while neutron/density crossplots can yield accurate formation porosity and clay-bound water volume. We have successfully combined NMR analysis with resistivity logs and neutron/density logs to derive the apparent hydrogen index, which can be used to establish correlations with oil viscosity and then to estimate oil viscosity in an extremely heavy oil field.The apparent hydrogen index is defined by:\n",

This relation has been successfully applied to a large heavy oil field to establish a 3D viscosity model.In summary, we presented several in situ fluid typing methods used in petrophysics, with special emphasis on one-dimensional and 2D NMR logging. Preliminary field test results have shown that these techniques are capable of delivering key reservoir parameters such as porosity, oil and water saturation, and oil viscosity.Recent developments in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging technology provide various efficient data acquisition schemes of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) echo trains with multiple wait times and multiple echo spacings in unique magnetic field gradients [1–3].

Since 2D NMR provides great contrast between different fluid components in terms of either diffusion coefficient (T\n",

Here we used a 2D cutoff method that divides a 2D map into several saturation regions according to prior knowledge of various fluids.Furthermore, different logging techniques give different types of measurements of petrophysical parameters. For example, resistivity logs usually give very accurate water saturation information based on Archie's law, while neutron/density crossplots can yield accurate porosity and clay-bound water volume. Combining NMR logging with resistivity and/or neutron/density logs provides us a third method for in situ fluid typing.

Under this circumstance, we often combine NMR-measured results with other logs for correct reservoir evaluation. For example, resistivity logs usually give a very accurate water volume ratio, while neutron/density crossplots can yield accurate formation porosity and clay-bound water volume. We have successfully combined NMR analysis with resistivity logs and neutron/density logs to derive the apparent hydrogen index, which can be used to establish correlations with oil viscosity and then to estimate oil viscosity in an extremely heavy oil field.The apparent hydrogen index is defined by:\n",

This relation has been successfully applied to a large heavy oil field to establish a 3D viscosity model.In summary, we presented several in situ fluid typing methods used in petrophysics, with special emphasis on one-dimensional and 2D NMR logging. Preliminary field test results have shown that these techniques are capable of delivering key reservoir parameters such as porosity, oil and water saturation, and oil viscosity.Recent developments in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging technology provide various efficient data acquisition schemes of Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) echo trains with multiple wait times and multiple echo spacings in unique magnetic field gradients [1–3].

Since 2D NMR provides great contrast between different fluid components in terms of either diffusion coefficient (T\n",

Here we used a 2D cutoff method that divides a 2D map into several saturation regions according to prior knowledge of various fluids.Furthermore, different logging techniques give different types of measurements of petrophysical parameters. For example, resistivity logs usually give very accurate water saturation information based on Archie's law, while neutron/density crossplots can yield accurate porosity and clay-bound water volume. Combining NMR logging with resistivity and/or neutron/density logs provides us a third method for in situ fluid typing. In the following, we shall briefly review each method with specific field examples.In this section, we introduce an FCD method that fits T\n",

Under this circumstance, we often combine NMR-measured results with other logs for correct reservoir evaluation. For example, resistivity logs usually give a very accurate water volume ratio, while neutron/density crossplots can yield accurate formation porosity and clay-bound water volume. We have successfully combined NMR analysis with resistivity logs and neutron/density logs to derive the apparent hydrogen index, which can be used to establish correlations with oil viscosity and then to estimate oil viscosity in an extremely heavy oil field.The apparent hydrogen index is defined by:\n",

This relation has been successfully applied to a large heavy oil field to establish a 3D viscosity model.In summary, we presented several in situ fluid typing methods used in petrophysics, with special emphasis on one-dimensional and 2D NMR logging. Preliminary field test results have shown that these techniques are capable of delivering key reservoir parameters such as porosity, oil and water saturation, and oil viscosity.The formation of lateritic Au deposits and anomalies in the regolith depends on the mobilization, transport and precipitation of Au in the weathering environment (Wilson, 1984). Sequential extractions have been used to study the association of Au and other trace elements with principle regolith fractions (Boyle, 1979; Lintern, 1989; Gray and Lintern, 1998; Xueqiu, 1998), and to infer element mobility. Other studies have shown that Au is mobile in the Australian regolith in and around mineralized zones (Mann, 1984; Gray and Lintern, 1998; Reith et al., 2005). For instance, at the Tomakin Park Gold Mine in south eastern New South Wales approximately 50wt% of the total Au in the Ah-horizon overlying the mineralized zone was associated with the water-, ammonium-acetate-, sodium pyrophosphate- and hydroxylamine-hydrochloride-soluble fractions; in contrast, in the unweathered quartz-vein material more than 95wt% of the Au was extractable only with concentrated aqua regia and appeared to be strongly bound in pyrite and arsenopyrite (Reith et al., 2005).There is growing evidence that microbiota contribute to the biogeochemical cycling of Au in the Australian regolith (Reith and McPhail, 2006; Reith et al., 2006). A microcosm study conducted by Reith and McPhail (2006) with auriferous soils from the Tomakin Park Gold Mine has shown that the indigenous microbiota of these soils are capable of solubilizing up to 80wt% of the finely disseminated Au adsorbed to the solid soil fractions as well as Au from the added Au pellets within 30–40 days of incubation, after which the solubilized Au was either adsorbed to the solid fractions or precipitated; in contrast, little to no Au was solubilized in biologically inactive (i.e., sterilized) microcosms. This behavior correlated with a change in the heterotrophic bacterial community structure in the microcosms from a dominantly carbohydrate- to an amino-acid utilizing population. They also found that the bacterial community in the early stages of the incubation produced amino acids, which may contribute to the solubilization of Au. Further evidence for this comes from in vitro studies with pure bacterial cultures, where it has been shown that microbially produced amino acids solubilize and form strong complexes with Au (Pares and Martinet, 1964; Lyalikova and Mockeicheva, 1969; Korobushkina et al., 1974; Korobushkina et al., 1983).Arsenic is an important pathfinder element for Au and commonly used in mineral exploration, because of its generally wider halo around primary mineralization, which makes it easier to detect in geochemical surveys (Cavender, 1963; Boyle and Jonasson, 1973; Boyle, 1979; Yang and Blum, 1999). In primary mineralization As and Au are commonly associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS; Boyle, 1979; King, 2002). Oxidation and subsequent breakdown of the mineral by iron- and sulfur oxidizing bacteria leads to the mobilization of As and Au (Nordstrom and Southam, 1997; Garcia-Sanchez and Alvarez-Ayuso, 2003; Papassiopi et al., 2003). The acidic and oxidizing conditions established by the bacteria not only create favorable conditions for indirect As and Au mobilization by dissolving the arsenopyrite, they also increase dissolved concentrations of these metals, and thus may contribute to their dispersion into the regolith (Bayard et al., 2006).In the regolith the speciation of As is controlled by the pH and redox conditions, (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002; Oremland and Stolz, 2003); where arsenate species (i.e., As(V) as \n",

The concentrations of dissolved arsenate and arsenite are controlled by surface complexation reactions on oxides and hydroxides of Al, Mn and especially Fe (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002; Oremland and Stolz, 2003). Arsenate is strongly adsorbed to Al-, Mn- and Fe-oxides under typical pH conditions, and as such unlikely to be mobile, whereas arsenite adsorbs less strongly and to fewer minerals and is the more mobile form (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002). Turnover of arsenate to arsenite and vice versa is used by a range of bacteria common in the regolith to gain metabolic energy, and thus resident microbiota may also contribute to the speciation and mobility of As in the regolith (Ahmann et al., 1997; Oremland and Stolz, 2003).While these findings suggest that Au and As may be highly mobile in and around mineralized zones in the Australian regolith, a recent study using sequential extractions with samples from the Tomakin Park Gold Mine suggests that the mobility of As, in contrast to Au mobility, is limited (Reith et al., 2005). There also is a need to understand the influence of microbial processes on the solubilization of Au and As under a wider range of environmental conditions. Therefore, the aims of this study are to: (i) infer the mobility of Au and As in regolith samples from a semi-arid and a tropical site by determining their fractionation using sequential extractions on progressively weathered materials; and (ii) assess the microbially mediated solubilization of Au and As in the different regolith materials using microcosms. Samples of auriferous soils and deeper regolith materials overlying the deposits were obtained from the Peak Hill Gold Mine in semi-arid New South Wales, and the Hit or Miss Mine in the Palmer River Goldfields in tropical north eastern Queensland.The results and discussion section consists of three subsections. In the first subsection the bulk geochemistry, the mineralogy of the regolith materials and the results of the sequential extraction for Au and As are presented. The second subsection focuses on the solubilization of Au and As in biologically active and inactive (sterilized) microcosms. In the third subsection the implications of these results for the mobility and mobilization of Au and As in the regolith are discussed.The results of this study show that Au is mobile in regolith materials from tropical and semi-arid areas in Australia, similar to the results of Reith and McPhail (2006) for a temperate area in Australia, whereas As mobility appear limited. Using biologically active versus inactive microcosms, we have demonstrated an effect of the indigenous microbiota of auriferous soils from semi-arid and tropical sites on the solubilization of Au, and for As in regolith from the tropical site. Thus, this study and Reith and McPhail (2006) have demonstrated that the activity of microorganisms needs to be taken into account when studying the mobility, solubilization and transport of Au and As in a wide range of regolith environments in Australia. The study has also shown that the capacity of microbiota to solubilize Au and As, and the timing and total concentrations of Au released into solution varies greatly between samples from different sites. This indicates that environmental factors such as climate, soil geochemistry, substrate quality and availability influence the microbially mediated solubilization of Au and As by influencing the composition and activity of the indigenous soil microbiota. More research is necessary to elucidate the specific mechanisms of how and when microbiota interact with the Au and As. The species, or groups of bacteria and other microorganisms that are affecting Au and As mobility need to be identified more specifically using modern molecular microbial approaches such as fingerprinting and sequencing of community 16S rDNA (Reith et al., 2006). In addition, the speciation of Au, e.g., dissolved complexes, colloids, needs to be identified. By making such detailed measurements we will be able to learn more about the mechanisms as well as the kinetics of these processes. Ultimately, we may be able to incorporate appropriate data into numerical geochemical models to predict Au and As transport, which will be useful in developing successful gold exploration and ore-processing strategies.Transformation is a mechanism of gene transfer in soil, sediment and other environments. In a transformation, DNA may be either integrated into genome or stay extrachromosomal elements in the form of plasmids, or phages (Stewart, 1989; Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1994). The application of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) carrying specific genetic modifications on plasmid DNA in the environment has raised concerns about transformation as a possible method for the horizontal dissemination of recombinant DNA molecules (Paget and Simonet, 1994; Cai et al., 2005).In soil environments, extracellular DNA molecules such as chromosomal and plasmid DNA were excreted actively by living cells or released from lysed cells (Reanney et al., 1983). These released DNA molecules, physically or chemically adsorbed by clay minerals, sand, humic acids, montmorillonite-humic acids-aluminum or iron hydroxypolymers and soils are partially protected against degradation by the nuclease and retain the capacity to transform competent bacterial cells (Romanowski et al., 1991; Khanna and Stotzky, 1992; Crecchio and Stotzky, 1998; Stotzky, 2000; Crecchio et al., 2005; Cai et al., 2006a). For example, Romanowski et al. (1992) monitored plasmid pUC8-ISP DNA for up to 60 days after introduction into loamy sand soil, clay soil and silty clay soil with four different methods including transformation of Ca2+-treated E. coli cells by the DNA extracted from soil. Gallori et al. (1994) reported that the transforming ability of chromosomal and plasmid DNA bound on Ca-montmorillonite persisted for 15 days in non-sterile soil under moist conditions.The protection mechanisms of DNA molecules by soil active particles have been studied by several soil biologists over the past years. The level of protection of DNA by soil particles varied significantly with DNA configuration and the type of the adsorbent (Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1987; Poly et al., 2000; Demaneche et al., 2001). Supercoiled plasmid DNA associated with kaolinite was easily degraded by nucleases as compared with linear chromosomal DNA (Poly et al., 2000). DNA adsorbed on quartz was more resistant to degradation by DNase I than that adsorbed by minor mineral fractions of the sand in 20mM MgCl2 (Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1987). Illite provided a lower level of protection for DNA molecules than montmorillonite and kaolinite (Demaneche et al., 2001). In our previous study, the higher level of protection of chromosomal DNA was found with montmorillonite and organic clays compared to kaolinite and inorganic clays with the method of agarose electrophoresis (Cai et al., 2006a).Except for the stability of extracellular DNA in soils, an important question is related to the abilities of these molecules to naturally transform bacteria. Transformation frequencies of Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas stutzeri and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus decreased with the decreasing molecular size of the DNA (Morrison and Guild, 1972; Carlson et al., 1983). The lack of purity of extracelluar DNA did not reduce its transforming activity in the environment (Juni and Heym, 1980; Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1991). The optimal temperature for natural transformation of B. subtilis by montmorillonite-DNA complex was 37°C (Khanna and Stotzky, 1992). Air-drying and wetting cycles negatively affected the transforming ability of clay-bound DNA, suggesting that water content is fundamental for the mechanisms of horizontal genetic exchange in soil environments (Pietramellara et al., 1997). The transformation efficiency of B. subtilis by chromosomal DNA adsorbed on sand was up to 50 times higher than that by free DNA (Lorenz et al., 1987). Other soil bacteria such as P. stutzeri and A. calcoaceticus showed the same level of transformation irrespective of whether chromosomal DNA was adsorbed or free (Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1990; Chamier et al., 1993; Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1994). As for plasmid DNA, transformation of A. calcoaceticus by bound plasmid DNA was much less efficient than by free plasmid molecules (Chamier et al., 1993). However, up to date, the protection mechanism of DNA by soil active particles to enzymatic degradation and biological availability of clay-bound DNA are not totally understood, as is also the influence of parameters such as mineral constituents, organic matter, and particle size of soil colloids. The aim of the current work is to investigate the transformation of CaCl2-treated E. coli by plasmid DNA bound on four different colloidal fractions from a Brown soil and clay minerals and the extent of protection of DNA exerted by these particles against nuclease degradation.Ca2+ is the predominant cation and its concentration ranges from 2.5 to 12.4mM in soils (Lindsay, 1980). The amount of DNA adsorption on soil colloids and minerals increased by 0.25–4 times in the presence of Ca2+ concentrations from 0 to 100mM (P<0.01) (Fig. 1), as has also been observed with other soil particles (Poly et al., 2000; Franchi et al., 2003). The promotive effect of Ca2+ on DNA adsorption may be attributed to the following reasons: (1) Ca2+ tends to suppress the formation of diffuse electrical double layers around clay particles, leading to increased contact between DNA and mineral surfaces (Aylmore and Quirk, 1960); (2) cations including Ca2+ form bridges between phosphate groups of the DNA molecules and the negatively charged sites of soil colloids and minerals (Romanowski et al., 1991; Paget et al., 1992). The adsorption process of DNA on soil particles could influence the availability for transforming competent strains. In our study, the efficiency of transformation by DNA bound on soil colloids and montmorillonite increased with increasing Ca2+ concentrations at which the complexes were formed (Fig. 3). It may be due to the extension of plasmid DNA through salt bridge facilitating DNA to interact with receptor sites on competent cells. Another reason may be related to the fact that the greater amount of DNA bound on soil colloidal particles at higher Ca2+ concentrations which provided more chances to contact competent cells. The electrostatic attraction of Ca2+ neutralizes the negative charges on DNA molecules and reduces their inter and intrarepulsion forces, thereby leading to a more compact molecular conformation (Tajmir-Riahi et al., 1993; Ma and Bloomfield, 1994). Observation of pure plasmid DNA with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LTSEM) also showed that DNA aggregated to form a weblike structure in the presence of Ca2+ (Poly et al., 2000). Thereby, our results also suggested that self-aggregation of plasmid DNA did not influence the transformation of competent cells.Efficiencies of transformation obtained by plasmid DNA bound on inorganic clays and kaolinite were lower than those obtained by complexes with organic clays and montmorillonite at different Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3). It was reported that DNA desorbing from sand during incubation with a cell-free filtrate of a competent cell suspension did not greatly contribute to transformation and competent cells of the three soil bacteria such as Pseudomonas fluorescens, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and A. calcoaceticus are capable of internalizing DNA directly from the mineral surfaces (Lorenz et al., 1990; Chamier et al., 1993). As for the examined soil colloids and minerals, kaolinite had a higher adsorption affinity for DNA than montmorillonite, and DNA molecules were more tightly adsorbed on inorganic clays and coarse clays compared with organic clays and fine clays, respectively (Fig. 2). Thereby, the lower efficiencies of transformation by plasmid DNA bound on kaolinite, inorganic clays and coarse clays may be attributed to their higher binding affinity for DNA which enabled competent cells difficult to internalize DNA directly from their surfaces. Our previous results showed that DNA changed its conformation from the B-form to the Z-form when bound on kaolinite and inorganic clays, whereas DNA bound on montmorillonite and organic clays retained its original conformation (Cai et al., 2006a). As a result, changes in the configuration of the DNA could also be responsible for the lower transforming ability of DNA bound on kaolinite and inorganic clays. Especially for kaolinite-DNA complexes prepared at 5–100mM of Ca2+, no transformants were observed, suggesting that the changes in the conformation of DNA cause it to be not identified by competent cells.DNA loosely adsorbed on montmorillonite was shown to be more resistant to nuclease degradation. Organic clays and fine clays on which DNA was loosely adsorbed had a higher capability of protecting DNA against degradation by DNase I than inorganic clays and coarse clays on which DNA was tightly adsorbed (Table 1). It suggests that the degradation of DNA in soil system is not governed by the affinity of DNA adsorption on soil colloids and clay minerals. Higher extents of protection provided by organic clays than inorganic clays may be ascribed to the formation of three-dimensional netted macropores on the surfaces of organic clays (Gianfreda et al., 1993; Rao et al., 1996), and DNA molecules could penetrate into these pores and become less accessible to nucleases. Adsorption of nucleases on soil colloidal particles could result in inactivation of enzyme activity and a reduction in biodegradation. Khanna and Stotzky (1992) recorded that even 277μg of DNase I bound on the equivalent of 1mg of montmorillonite did not reduce transformation by 30μg of free DNA as much as 1.2μg of free DNase I did, suggesting that the activity of bound DNase I had reduced significantly. In our lab, experiment on the adsorption of DNase I on soil colloids and minerals showed that nuclease adsorption was significantly greater on coarse and fine organic clays than on the corresponding inorganic clays, and montmorillonite also showed a greater adsorption capacity for DNase I than kaolinite (Cai et al., 2006a). These results confirmed that the protection of DNA by soil particles against enzymatic degradation was related to the adsorption of the nuclease which resulted in the loss of the enzyme activity.In conclusion, plasmid DNA bound on montmorillonite, organic clays and fine clays was not only more resistant to nuclease degradation but also had higher transformation efficiencies. The adsorption affinity of DNA for soil colloid or mineral and a conformational change in the DNA molecule when bound on clays may determine the efficiencies of transformation. The presence of organic matter and an efficient adsorption of nucleases on soil colloids and minerals appear to be responsible for the lower degradation of DNA in soil ecosystems.\n"
